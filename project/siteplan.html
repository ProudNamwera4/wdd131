            <h2>CityAcademyFC.com</h2>
            <p>For this project, I have chosen the site name: <strong>CityAcademyFC.com</strong></p>
            <p>I chose this site name because it clearly communicates the name and purpose of the soccer/football club,
                which is
                to provide a platform for players, parents, and fans to access information, news, and resources related
                to the
                club.</p>

            <p>The purpose of the City Academy website is to provide a central hub for information, news, and resources
                related
                to the club. The site will serve as a platform for players, parents, and fans to access important
                information,
                stay up-to-date on the latest news and events, and connect with the club.</p>
            <p>The site will provide the following services and information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Club news and updates</li>
                <li>Team schedules and scores</li>

                <li>Contact information and forms</li>

            </ul>
            <p>By providing a comprehensive and user-friendly platform, the City Academy website aims to enhance the
                overall
                experience for players, parents, and fans, while also promoting the club's mission and values.</p>
